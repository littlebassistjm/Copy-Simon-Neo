    <string name="instructions_classic">When the game starts, the buttons would light up in a random order and play sounds that vary per button.
        You would then have to repeat the same sequence in the exact same order that the buttons were lit up.</string>
    <string name="instructions_multiplayer">This mode is the same as classic but requires 2 players.
        Each player will be assigned two (2) keys.
        The players will share one sequence and they need to complete the sequence by only pressing their assigned buttons.
